    abstract = {{It is now clear that as a result of this ubiquitous environment and the sheer volume of
their interaction with it, today's students  think and process information fundamentally 
differently from their predecessors. These differences go far further and deeper than most 
educators suspect or realize.  ” Different kinds of experiences lead to different brain 
structures,  ”  says Dr. Bruce D. Berry of Baylor College of Medicine.  As we shall see in 
the next installment, it is very likely that our students' brains have physically changed – 
and are different from ours – as a result of how they grew up.  But whether or not this is 
literally true, we can say with certainty that their  thinking patterns have changed. I will 
get to how they have changed in a minute. 
What should we call these  ” new” students of  today? Some refer to them as the N-[for
Net]-gen or D-[for digital]-gen. But the most useful designation I have found for them is
Digital Natives.  Our students today are all  ” native speakers” of  the digital language of 
computers, video games and the Internet.}},

What are the professional, social, and political impacts of this new brain evolution? How must you adapt and at what price? While high-tech immersion can accelerate learning and boost creativity, it also has its glitches, among them the meteoric rise in ADD diagnoses, increased social isolation, and Internet addiction. To compete and thrive in the age of brain evolution, and to avoid these potential drawbacks, we must adapt, and iBrain--with its Technology Toolkit--equips us with tools and strategies needed to close the brain gap.--From publisher description.}},
