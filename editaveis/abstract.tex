  \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}

Many free software projects have no practices to improve usability in their development process, which may influences on the adoption of them.
%
The free software production can be considered an agile methodology from the software engineering point of view.
%
The objective of this work was to apply usability tasks through agile usability techniques in open source communities.
%
For this, we used a systematic literature review and survey for usability in open source software and a case study in order to use them in a real context so raised by the results of evaluation methods.
